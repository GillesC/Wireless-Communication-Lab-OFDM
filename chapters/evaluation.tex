\chapter{Evaluation}

Evaluation of this lab session will consider students' work attitude throughout the session and a final test to assess their acquisition of requisite skills and knowledge.

Students have the option to collaborate in groups of up to two. However, it's essential to note that assignments must be completed individually. This means each student should be capable of repeating the lab session independently, as their performance will be evaluated during the final test. Additionally, when the students are referred to external sources during the assignment, this must be also known for the final test.
Further instructions will be given during the lab sessions.
